      Santa’s Enchanted Forest has been a South Florida annual holiday tradition for more than 37 years.  Each year, hundreds of thousands of Miami Dade residents visit Santa’s, including more than 30,000 underprivileged children and families that are admitted FREE. As SEF’s lease with Miami-Dade County comes to an end in March 2020 and the land at Tropical Park undergoes the lengthy duration of a new solicitation process for 2021 and beyond, the community is at risk of losing this beloved holiday event and over 1000 jobs for the 2020 holiday season.
While Santa's plans on bidding for a new long term lease agreement and spending millions of dollars in park improvements, that decision will not take place in time for the 2020 season.  That is why we are asking for your help!
HELP US keep the holiday magic alive by signing #SaveSantas2020 Petition urging Miami-Dade County to extend Santa’s Enchanted Forest’s lease at Tropical Park for the 2020 Holiday Season.

**THERE IS NO NEED TO DONATE ANY FUNDS TO THIS CAUSE.  A donation feature is put on by Change.org and not this organization**** It can be skipped.
